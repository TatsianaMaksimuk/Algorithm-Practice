//Java was developed by James Gosling in 1995 at Sun Microsystems and later was acquired by Oracle.

// class is a container for related functions. We use it to organize our code
//Packages are containers where we group related classes
//Every program has Main class that contains the Main Function (Method)
// Methods are smallest building blocks in Java programs
//Java allows us to break down programs into small building blocks that are easy to understand and use and reuse.
//Methods have access modifiers (public - means accessible from other parts of the program. Also,private.
//Class naming PascalNaming, methods - camelCase

 public  class Main {
   public static void main (String[] args) { //function Main is an entry point, the main function is called - code inside executes
//function inside a class is method
       System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}

//We use JDK (Java Development Kit) to build apps. JDK has JRE (Java Runtime Environment),compiler and library of classes.
//The structure of JRE makes Java platform independent (can be written on one OS and executed on another)
//The Java compiler takes Java code and compiles it into Java Bytecode cross-platform format. When we run app, JVM (Java Virtual Machine) takes bytecode and translates it into OS native code.
//
//Java editions: Standard Edition (SE): the core; Enterprise Edition (EE): for large systems, Micro Edition (ME):for mobile devices; Java Card: used in smart cards

// Variables are used for temporarily data storage. In Java, the variable should be specified at the time of declaration.
